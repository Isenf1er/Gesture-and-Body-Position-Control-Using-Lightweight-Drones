# Gesture and Body Position Control Using Lightweight Drones
This repository contains a snippet of a project worked on by Amna Hayat, Calvin Li, Nicholas Prakoso, and Renzheng Zheng. The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of enhancing drone capabilities in low-light environments using gesture and body pose recognition using the Crazyflie 2.1 drone. Included files are documentation of initial setup process and a snippet of our soon to be published IEEE style paper.

## About Us
This project was selected by us as a team for our capstone project at the University of Maryland, College Park in an effort to enhance drone capabilities in low-light environments while utilizing the tools and skills learned over the recent semesters which include, but are not limited to, machine learning algorithms, hardware programming, and debugging. Additionally, a considerable amount of research was put into this work and as a result, we decided to publish an IEEE paper for the 5th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Swinburne University of Technology of our findings and the results of our work/research.

## Presentation Video
Below is a short presentation video of the overall paper we wrote and what can be found from our research and project.
